<h2> Why I like the movie</h2>

<p> This movie makes me think of the times when I played football and how I enjoyed spending time playig the game with my teammates and friends.  I enjoy the story and really like the lessons that can be learned from how people may have lived in that time.</p>

<h2> Favorite Actor</h2>
<p> My favorite actor in this movie an many others is Denzel Washington. Denzel has a great talent to become his role and bring the audience along for the ride.<p/>
